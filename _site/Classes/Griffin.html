Secret move unlocks:
- can extend the boomerang
- can propel self in the air 3 spaces (by pushing off the ground)
- can hit two people at once
- can be used on same person (have to roll for each one
- ^ double hits have to follow a reasonable boomerang shape
 -->

## Lvl 2: "echo" (Mirror Portal)
```yaml
roll: 3+ on 1d6
recharge: 3 turns
```

Cast a portal at any location within 2 dashes

- absorbs any physical or spell based attack
- damage reflected back at attack (who either takes the damage or has to use a dodge to escape).
    - amount of damage reflected depends on the damage from the attacker's roll

> You'll know how much damage is coming at you before you have to decide, which may determine whether you want to use the move (chalk it up to magic vision)

Can be cast as a reaction.

> [!World]
> The timing of the "absorb" and "reflect" aspects of the mirror are staggered 1 action unit in time. Otherwise, reflecting matter back would just cause something to collide into itself and do nothing.
 -->
<!-- secret move: cast a portal below yourself and jump in it; can be used as counter that is always successful regardless of whether opp meets roll threshold -->

<!-- 
## Lvl 3 (special): "ex-lynk" (Current)

```yaml
roll: 6+ on 1d20 >>
charge: 1 turn
recharge: 1 day
```

Throw the boomerang in a large cone (w/ length of 5 dashes). Everyone in the cone (including teammates):

- takes damage equal to the dice rollover
- are stunned

> cuz they're stunned by the electrocution

nat 20: get an extra boomerang throw before your turn ends -->
