```yaml
roll: 3+ on 1d6 >> x2
recharge: 3 turns
range: 4 paces
```

Breath a powerful stream fire towards anyone within 2 dashes

> think: cyclops from x-men, but with fire

- damage rollover can be spread across opponents
- drop as many "fire tiles" as you have rolls
    - each one deals +2 damage if stepped on
    - each tile has to be adjacent to the last
    - tiles last 2 rounds

```yaml
roll: 6+ on 1d20 >>
charge: 1 turn
recharge: 1 day
```

Recharge all spells

Then: Perform an additional number of actions equal to the roll.

Rules:

- can only be used when health is 5 or fewer
- can be used in response to getting attacked if resulting is health is 5 or fewer (i.e., a conditional reaction spell)
