# Combat

For each round, for each player, perform 3 actions in any order:

| Action           | Effect                       | roll      |
| -                | -                            | -         |
| do nothing       | <--                          |           |
| dash (ced)       | move 1 dash (tile)           |           |
| punch            | 1 damage                     |           |
| weapon           | up to 4 damage (use roll)    | 2+ on 1d4 |
| cast base spell  | see [base spells]            |           |
| cast lvl 1 spell | see [class]; 1 turn recharge | 3+ on 1d6 |

<!-- | cast spell 2    | see [class]; 3 turn recharge | 3+ on 1d6   | -->
<!-- | cast special    | see [class]; 1 day recharge  | 6+ on 1d20  | -->
<!-- | cast ultimate   | 1 per campaign             | always land | -->

If you haven't used all 3 actions yet, you can do the following outside of your turn:

| Action  | Effect                                          | roll |
| -       | -                                               | -    |
| dodge   | move 1 dash away from target; don't take damage |      |
| counter | if opponent's melee fails, free weapon swipe    |      |
| cast    | some spells can be case as reactions            |      |

## Conflict Logic

1. Attacker declares action
2. Defender (if any) declares response (dodge, counter)
3. Both roll same die
    - **dodge**: roll past attacker's threshold (i.e., 3+ on a d6 for a lvl 1 spell)
    - **counter**: roll at or higher than attack's roll
